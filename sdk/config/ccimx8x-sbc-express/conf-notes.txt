Digi Embedded Yocto provides the following image recipes:

  * dey-image-qt: graphical QT image

    By default the image is XWayland-based so it provides a full Weston
    desktop environment.

    To compile the image for the framebuffer (instead of XWayland) add
    the following line to the project's conf/local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = "x11 wayland vulkan"

  * dey-image-aws: console-only image supporting Amazon Web Services IoT

    This image includes the AWS Greengrass Core and an AWS IoT platform
    example application. For more information on AWS support in Digi
    Embedded Yocto see the online documentation.
