Digi Embedded Yocto provides the following image recipes:

  * dey-image-qt: graphical QT image

    By default the image is X11-based so it provides a full SATO theme
    desktop environment.

    To compile the image for the framebuffer (instead of X11) add the
    following line to the project's conf/local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = "x11"

  * core-image-base: a console-only image

    Expansion of native core-image-base by including all the support for the
    target device hardware like firmware files, rootfs customizations, etc.
