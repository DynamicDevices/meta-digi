Digi Embedded Yocto provides the following image recipes:

  * dey-image-qt: graphical QT image

    By default the image is X11-based so it provides a full SATO theme
    desktop environment.

    To compile the image for the framebuffer (instead of X11) add the
    following line to the project's conf/local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = "x11"

  * dey-image-aws: console-only image supporting Amazon Web Services IoT

    This image includes the AWS Greengrass Core and an AWS IoT platform
    example application. For more information on AWS support in Digi
    Embedded Yocto see the online documentation.
